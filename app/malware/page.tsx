                <h1 className="info-text">In order to prevent malware, great care is required with regard to the programs and files that one downloads. Install a good antivirus and never visit any suspicious sites or click on links and pop-ups that are unknown to you. Never download programs from suspicious sources, including cracked or free versions, and regularly remove questionable software. If your computer is infected with ransomware, immediately disconnect from the network, don't pay the ransom, and use some trusted tools like No More Ransom for file recovery. Keeping your system and passwords secure, monitoring for suspicious behavior, and being alert for phishing is part of the prime defenses in protecting your device from malware.</h1>
